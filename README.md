# Notes and prototypes for pyre

This repository is a dumping ground for my code and documents that
are related to pyre but not actually part of pyre - this might include
rough documentation that isn't vetted or maintained and therefore is
not part of the official docs, or small prototypes to illustrate
architectural ideas.

Some examples:
- overlays: this directory contains some simple python code mimicing
  the pyre environment stack in order to illustrate the concepts
  behind different ways of implementing support for unsaved changes
